# Node / NPM versions

# Start Coding

The quickest way to contribute changes to the DeSo Frontend is the following these steps:

1. Open frontend repo in Gitpod

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/deso-protocol/frontend)

You can use any repo / branch URL and just prepend `https://gitpod.io/#` to it.

2. If needed, login to your github account

3. Set the correct `lastLocalNodeV2` to `"https://api.tijn.club"` in your browser Local Storage for the gitpod preview URL

4. Create a new branch to start working

To commit / submit a pull request from gitpod, you will need to give gitpod additional permissions to your github account: `public_repo, read:org, read:user, repo, user:email, workflow` which you can do on the [GitPod Integrations page](https://gitpod.io/integrations).
