# BitClout Frontend
This is the repository for the reference BitClout Angular app. It serves as an
interface that allows users to interact with the data on the BitClout blockchain.

Please refer to [the README for the core repo](https://github.com/bitclout/core) for
more info.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

After proper configuration of `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
